## About

This is an Open Source Video Conferencing App that utilizes Flutter and WebRTC technologies to provide users with a platform to conduct virtual meetings, conferences, and webinars. The app is built to provide seamless audio and video communication, as well as screen sharing, chat functionality, and file sharing.

## Why is this so awesome?

* 🌀 **Flutter WASM Support**: Seamlessly integrate with `Flutter WebAssembly` for enhanced performance.
* 🕵🏻 **Anonymous Access**: Join meetings without the need for registration or login.
* 👥 **Multiple Participants**: `Waterbus` enables high-quality group video calls using `WebRTC SFU`.
* 💻 **Screen Sharing**: Share your screen with the participants of your call.
* 🎥 **Video Codec Support**: Supports a wide range of video codecs including `AV1`, `H.264`, `H.265`, `VP8`, and `VP9`.
* 🌌 **Virtual Background**: Enhance your meetings with professional virtual backgrounds.
* 🖼️ **Picture-in-Picture**: Increase productivity with picture-in-picture multitasking.
* 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure secure meetings with end-to-end encryption.
* 💬 **Encrypted Chat**: Communicate privately with encrypted messaging during video calls.
* 💋 **Beauty Filter**: Using [GPUPixel](https://github.com/pixpark/gpupixel) to implement Beauty Filters
* 💬 **Subtitles**: Enable subtitles for better accessibility and understanding during calls.

## Goal

My project isn't intended to replace standard video conferencing platforms like `Google Meet`. Instead, it focuses on facilitating code sharing. I've noticed that features such as `Virtual Background` or `Picture in Picture` aren't widely implemented in existing solutions, and there's a lack of reference code for them. Many developers resort to third-party solutions for video calls but often miss out on these features. My goal is to provide a reference project that includes these functionalities, offering developers a starting point for integrating them into their own products.
