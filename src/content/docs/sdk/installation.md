title: Installation
description: Install pub.dev waterbus_sdk
---

## Install Rust

* Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Add dependency

* Add the dependency from command-line

```bash
$ flutter pub add waterbus_sdk
```

* The command above will add this to the pubspec.yaml file in your project (you can do this manually):

```yaml
dependencies:
  waterbus_sdk: ^1.5.1
```

## Configuration

### Android

Ensure the following permission is present in your Android Manifest file, located in `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
```

If you need to use a Bluetooth device, please add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
```

The Flutter project template adds it, so it may already be there.

Also you will need to set your build settings to Java 8, because official WebRTC jar now uses static methods in `EglBase` interface. Just add this to your app level `build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    //...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

Setup for Beauty Filters:

- Add gpupixel in dependencies:

```gradle
implementation 'tech.waterbus:gpupixel:1.0.2'
```

/**
 *  This is an application-specific wrapper class that exists to expose the intersection of an
 *  application's active activity and an application's visible view to a [FlutterEngine] for
 *  rendering.
 *
 *  Omitted features from the [io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity] include:
 *   * **State restoration**. If you're integrating at the view level, you should handle activity
 *      state restoration yourself.
 *   * **Engine creations**. At this level of granularity, you must make an engine and attach.
 *      and all engine features like initial route etc must be configured on the engine yourself.
 *   * **Splash screens**. You must implement it yourself. Read from
 *     `addOnFirstFrameRenderedListener` as needed.
 *   * **Transparency, surface/texture**. These are just [FlutterView] level APIs. Set them on the
 *      [FlutterView] directly.
 *   * **Intents**. This doesn't do any translation of intents into actions in the [FlutterEngine].
 *      you must do them yourself.
 *   * **Back buttons**. You must decide whether to send it to Flutter via
 *      [FlutterEngine.getNavigationChannel.popRoute()], or consume it natively. Though that
 *      decision may be difficult due to https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/67011.
 *   * **Low memory signals**. You're strongly encouraged to pass the low memory signals (such
 *      as from the host `Activity`'s `onTrimMemory` callbacks) to the [FlutterEngine] to let
 *      Flutter and the Dart VM cull its own memory usage.
 *
 * Your own [FlutterView] integrating application may need a similar wrapper but you must decide on
 * what the appropriate intersection between the [FlutterView], the [FlutterEngine] and your
 * `Activity` should be for your own application.

### iOS

Add the following entry to your _Info.plist_ file, located in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Camera Usage!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Microphone Usage!</string>
```

This entry allows your app to access camera and microphone.

### Note for iOS.
The WebRTC.xframework compiled after the m104 release no longer supports iOS arm devices, so need to add the `config.build_settings['ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH'] = 'YES'` to your ios/Podfile in your project

ios/Podfile

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
     target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      # Workaround for https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/64502
      config.build_settings['ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH'] = 'YES' # <= this line
     end
  end
end
```
